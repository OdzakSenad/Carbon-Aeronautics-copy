# Part XII: PID Controller

In this part, you will learn how you can stabilise your quadcopter drone using a PID controller. The controller that will be used will stabilise the drone based on its roll, pitch and yaw rotation rates. Because this part will be used to derive the necessary equations for a PID controller, there is no code. All explanations can be found in the Youtube video below.
