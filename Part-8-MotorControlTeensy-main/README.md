# Part VIII: Use your Teensy to control a brushless motor 

This project explains how you can program your Teensy 4.0 microcontroller to control a brushless motor. The FS-IA6B receiver is used to give instructions to the Teensy, which will be in turn transformed to a PWM signal that is fed to the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). The Youtube video below explains the electronic circuit and the necessary code.
